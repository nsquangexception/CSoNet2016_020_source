\section{Conclusion and future work} \label{conclusion}

In this paper, we have proposed Word Embedding Restricted Boltzmann Machines model to jointly identify aspect categories and classify sentiment polarities in the supervised setting.
Our approach modifies standard RBM model and combine it with WEM, which not only helps reduce dimension of the input vectors but also gives the RBM model prior knowledge for more accurate classification.
Our experimental results show that this model can outperform state-of-the-art models.

In the future, we plan to collect Vietnamese review dataset with diverse domains and combine our WE-RBM with stacked RBMs to form Deep Belief Networks.
We hope that it will solve the aspect identification and sentiment classification tasks as well as RBM family methods.
